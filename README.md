# üåç Global MedConnect ‚Äì A Cross-Border Digital Health Access Platform

This GitHub repository outlines the early-stage development of my research concept, Global MedConnect, which I propose to carry out in collaboration with the respective research faculty.

Global MedConnect is a digital platform designed to provide A Mobile Health Access Platform for Migrant Women as well as underserved or mobile populations with cross-border access to affordable, verified medical care. It combines principles of health equity, telemedicine, AI translation, and global digital health to overcome geographic, linguistic, and economic barriers in healthcare delivery.

## üîπ Problem Statement

Millions of patients‚Äîespecially migrants women's, uninsured individuals, or those in medical deserts‚Äîstruggle to access reliable, affordable healthcare across borders. Language barriers, financial opacity, and lack of verified information amplify health inequities. There is a critical need for a centralized platform that allows:

- Price-transparent, cross-country medical treatment comparisons
- Secure sharing and translation of medical records
- Access to trusted, certified global health providers
- Navigation of travel and legal requirements for treatment abroad

## üîπ Research Objectives

This project aims to:
1. Design and prototype a web-based platform connecting patients with global healthcare options
2. Use AI/NLP tools to translate and summarize medical reports and prescriptions
3. Build a cost comparison engine using live currency and treatment data
4. Pilot partnerships with clinics and hospitals in multiple countries

This aligns well with interdisciplinary research interests in global health, digital equity, health policy, and responsible AI.
