# üåç Global MedConnect ‚Äì A Cross-Border Digital Health Access Platform

This GitHub repository outlines the early-stage development of my research concept, Global MedConnect, which I propose to carry out in collaboration with the respective research faculty.

Global MedConnect is a digital platform designed to provide A Mobile Health Access Platform for Migrant Women as well as underserved or mobile populations with cross-border access to affordable, verified medical care. It combines principles of health equity, telemedicine, AI translation, and global digital health to overcome geographic, linguistic, and economic barriers in healthcare delivery.

## üîπ Problem Statement

Millions of patients‚Äîespecially migrants women's, uninsured individuals, or those in medical deserts‚Äîstruggle to access reliable, affordable healthcare across borders. Language barriers, financial opacity, and lack of verified information amplify health inequities. There is a critical need for a centralized platform that allows:

- Price-transparent, cross-country medical treatment comparisons
- Secure sharing and translation of medical records
- Access to trusted, certified global health providers
- Navigation of travel and legal requirements for treatment abroad

## üìå Vision

- Millions of migrants, travelers, and expatriates face barriers to healthcare access due to:

- Search for and connect with healthcare providers in their preferred language
- Access culturally appropriate medical consultations
- Request telemedicine appointments across borders

## üîπ Proposed Use Cases

- Refugee women seeking maternal care abroad
- Patients requiring second opinions for complex diagnoses
- NGOs helping patients locate affordable treatment centers
- Medical tourism with verified provider transparency
